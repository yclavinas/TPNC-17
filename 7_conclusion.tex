\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We proposed an experimental analysis of the impact of the tournament size on the BBOB benchmark functions. We verified that there are little mathematical or experimental studies that supports a choice of value for the tournament size. Usually, the tournament size is chosen to be 2 or 3, based on ``previous results''.
 
 
We analyzed a group of tournament size values and we found that no significant relationship was discovered.

We are aware that our work is limited to few tournament size values. Also, we understand that the other parameters may have some influence in the results. We know that there is much more that could be done in this field of study, therefore we propose that more investigations need to be done, in order to truly understand the role of the tournament size value related to the quality of final results. For that, we suggest that some kind of adaptative algorithm should be explored. Also, we would like to explore whether our results were mainly related with a particular set of GA operators.
