The tournament selection holds a popular condition among Genetic Algorithm Selection schemes. In this work we want to observe the impact into the quality of the Genetic Algorithm applied to the BBOB benchmark functions given the variety of one of its parameter, the tournament size. From the literature, we found out that there is a predilection to values for the tournament size, such as 2 or 3. To analyze this impact, we examined the results of different values for the selection operator through simulations the 24 BBOB noise free benchmarks functions with 10, 20 and 40 dimensions and comparing their behavior. The results indicate that for the BBOB benchmark functions the impact of chaging the values of the tournament size have little impact into the quality of the results.
