\section{Introduction}\label{intro}



 In this paper, the main goal is to observe the performance XXX a real-valued Genetic Algorithm, GGABBOB applied to 24 noise-free 40 dimensions BBOB benchmark functions. To achieve that, we first explore the number of individuals to be selected by the Tournament operator. Then we analyze the results of the GA-BBOB to verify any relationship between applying the Tournament operator in the ``generating earthquake risk model'' function and applying tht Tournament operator in all the benchmark functions.


%TODO:
%change this when the scope is complete
These adaptions are described here and there. we do this and that here and there too. results and other stuff are here and there.
