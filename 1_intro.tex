\section{Introduction}\label{intro}


 In this paper, the main goal is to observe the performance of the tournament selection in a real-valued Genetic Algorithm, named the GA-BBOB. For that we applied the GA-BBOB to 24 noise-free BBOB benchmark functions with 10, 20 and 40 dimensions, for more information see ~\cite{hansen2010real}. To achieve that, we first explore the number of individuals (k) to be selected by the Tournament operator, with values from 2 to 25. These values are arbitrarily chosen. Then we analyze the results of the GA-BBOB to verify any relationship between all the benchmark functions. Then we propose an alternative, an auto-adaptative k-value ``generator''. This alternative is done with the objective of chosing the ideal value of k.
