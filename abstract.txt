The tournament selection holds a popular place among Genetic Algorithm Selection schemes. In this work we want to observe the impact of the the tournament size on the quality of the Genetic Algorithm applied to the BBOB benchmark functions. We found out from the literature that there is a predilection to small values for the tournament size, such as 2 or 3. We examine the results of different values of the tournament size using 24 BBOB noise free benchmarks functions with 10, 20 and 40 dimensions and comparing their behavior. The results indicate that for the BBOB benchmark functions changing the values of the tournament size has little impact on the quality of the results.
