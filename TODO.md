# OTHER:

Where is data about the relative intensity method?  



# Images

Add an image/table explaining the possible combinations of GA/Reduced and EMP*/NoEmp
(Introduction or methodology)  

Add an image explaining the differences of the representations between the 
GAmodel and the ReducedGAModel (methodology section)  

Add an image with the flowchart for the EMP* methods (methodology section)  




# General

The idea of the paper is to try and improve GA-generated models of earthquake
risk.  

We try three approaches: 

1.Genome structure: The GA either tries to adjust the risk estimation of each 
bin (original model), or the location of "mainshocks" (reduced model)

2.Use of expert knowledge: (emp vs non emp)

3.Use of clustering of the database

In this paper, we study each of the three approaches and test them to determine
which approaches produce the best models.

*Important* treat the three approaches as separate axis, expain each of them 
one at a time. 

*Important* check each of the sentences in the paper on how they relate
(explain or follow) the goals above.
