\section{GA-BBOB}\label{sec:proposed:ga-bbob}

In the work, we propose the GA-BBOB, which is a real-valued Genetic Algorithm to explore the search space of the 24 noise free 40-D BBOB benchmark functions. In some aspects the GA-BBOB implementation is equal to the GAModel. That is mainly true for all evolutionary operators. The search space of the benchmark functions are distinct from the GAModel search space, we reformulated the Genome Representation and the Fitness Function.

\subsubsection*{Genome Representation and Evolutionary Tools.}
Each individual is represented as real valued array, where each element is one input to a 40-D noise free benchmark BBOB function. Therefore, each individual of the GA-BBOB has size of 40 real value elements. Each element's values has values between the interval [-5, 5], once those function are limited by these values. As in the GAModel it is used the Two-Point crossover, elitism and polynomial bounded mutation are used as evolutionary operators. The relevant parameters were set as Elite Size = 1, Crossover chance = 0.9, Mutation Chance = 0.1. For the Polynomial Bounded parameters, a small modification, when comparing to the GAModel, was made: eta = 1, low = -5, up = 5.


\subsubsection*{Fitness Function.}
The fitness function considered are the 40-D noise free benchmark BBOB function. For more information, please refer to the work of Hansen et al.~\cite{hansen2010real}.
Consequently, the GA-BBOB has 24 different fitness functions.

%add here the PRCGA and the restart and number of eval stuff
\subsubsection*{Minor Adaptations.}
%check if this is the most current work on ga and bbob
Chuang et al.~\cite{chuang2012black}, proposed a Genetic Algorithm specific to run on the noise free BBOB benchmark functions. Some good practices presented in this work were incorporated to the GAModel and to the GA-BBOB. These practice are the concept of ``restart strategy'' and the concept of ``alleviate stagnation''.

The restart strategy concept is defined by Chuang et al. as: ``For each restart, the initial population  is uniformly and randomly sampled within the search space. Whenever the restart condition is met, the algorithm will be reinitialized without using any information about the last test run. This process is iterated until the stopping criteria are met, i.e., maximum number of function evaluations has been reached, or the function value is less than the target precision.''

The restart condition used for both GAModel and GA-BBOB is that the standard deviation of the current population is smaller that $10^{-12}$. When the restart condition is contemplated the algorithm population is reinitialized randomly, as in the first initialization. In the GAModel and in the GA-BBOB, we consider information about the last run, by utilizing the Elitism strategy on the best individual prior to the restart. The maximum number of function evaluations chosen is ($10^5$) and the target precision chosen is ($10^{-8}$), values compatible with the ones in the previous work.
