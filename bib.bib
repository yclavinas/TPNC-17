abstract="In this study, a genetic algorithm with global searching
                  capability was incorporated into a neural network
                  calculating process to obtain a highly reliable
                  model for predicting peak ground acceleration, which
                  is the key element in evaluating earthquake response
                  and in establishing a seismic design standard. In
                  addition to three seismic parameters (i.e. local
                  magnitude, focal distance, and epicentre depth),
                  this study included two geological conditions
                  (i.e. standard penetration test value and shear-wave
                  velocity) in the input to reflect the site response
                  adequately. Based on the earthquake records and soil
                  test data from 86 checking stations, within 24
                  seismic subdivision zones in the Taiwan area, the
                  computational results show that using a combination
                  of a neural network and genetic algorithm can
                  achieve a higher performance compared with solely
                  using a neural network model. Furthermore, a
                  weight-based model was developed for predicting peak
                  ground acceleration at an unmonitored site to
                  represent each subdivision zone. The results show
                  that three subdivision zones have higher horizontal
                  peak ground accelerations than the seismic design
                  value as required in the building code. The obtained
                  information might be helpful in relevant engineering
                  applications for the studied region, and the
                  proposed method for treating this type of nonlinear
                  seismic data might be applicable in other areas of
                  interest worldwide.",
